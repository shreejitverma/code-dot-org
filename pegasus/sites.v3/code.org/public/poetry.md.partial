## Learn more about Coding with Poetry

In the Coding with Poetry module in CS Connections, students will be able to see two subjects - computer science and poetry - in a new way. Over the course of five lessons, 4-8th-grade students build a poem-generating program to recite different versions of a haiku they wrote. Then, students test their programs with their classmates and complete the project by sharing their user-generated poems in a poetry circle.

By building a poem generator, students learn about how computers take in user input, store it in memory, and output a desired product. By writing their own haikus, students explore elements of poetry like grammar, mood, and word choice.

<em>Our Poem Art Hour of Code activity is also the first lesson in the Coding with Poetry module of our Computer Science Connections curriculum. <a href="https://csteachers.org/events/csedweek-2021-inspire-am/">Register here for a special session of CodeBytes</a> on Tuesday, December 7, at 10 a.m. ET and again at 10 a.m. PT; we'll show students how to get started with the Poem Art Hour of Code activity.</em>
